# AI-as-a-learning-tool
This repository contains the full report and accompanying materials for the educational project "AI as a Learning Tool" by Alberto Calcara and Cristian Di Tucci.

The project explores the practical use of free AI tools in both teaching and independent learning contexts. We approached this from two complementary perspectives:

Professor's perspective: Can a lecture be designed and delivered using only AI-generated content?

Student's perspective: Can someone learn a new topic from scratch using AI, without prior materials or instruction?

We tested various tools like ChatGPT, Chalkie.ai, and Narakeet.ai under a zero-budget constraint, critically analyzing their strengths, limitations, and overall suitability for academic use. Additionally, we explored interactive learning enhancements using Gemini 2.5 Pro, with a live demo app included in the repo.

CONTENTS:
- the full written report in PDF
- the fully voiced lecture created using the process described in the report
- the 'parity bit' interactive app created using Gemini 2.5 pro
